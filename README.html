    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>These notes assume that the <b>Family Tree Project</b> folder is copied and filed in total, including all associated folders, images and styles.</p>
    <p> The <b>Family Tree project</b> is centred around Mary Elizabeth Kellett (nee Brown) 1927-2020</p>
    <p>The reasoning for this is both personal and Mary, being an only child, gives a good pivot to the past and the future.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Please have a browse. The Census records provide some absorbing information.</p>
    <p>In these records. I believe the longest lived and shortest lived in all the records were sisters. There is a photo.</p>
    <p>Who lived in the same house for the longest period?</p>
    <p>Anyone have other observations?</p>
